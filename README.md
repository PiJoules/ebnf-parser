## TODO
- Reimplement using new matching method with iterators.
- Could instead return value to some other function inside ProductionRule instead of calling protected method.
- Support nested concatentations
  - The last testcase fails because on the first iteration of concatentations, all attempts fail so the loop ends there with no possibele valid productions
